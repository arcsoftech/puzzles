# puzzles
This is a collection of various puzzles I've come across and solved. These include Project Euler challenges, 
various puzzles I've solved for fun, as well as interview problems I was asked to solve.

Why am I posting these? Because I regret not posting the challenges/assignments I wrote back in college and have 
inadvertently lost. Some of those challenges were quite elegant, like my minesweeper program implemented in assembly, 
my lisp sokoban solver that used a number of heuristics and optimizations to solve some complex problems, as well as 
my solution to Symantec nanorg challenge - which didn't win but was elegant and simple.

I also believe that ideas should be free, they're meant to be shared witht he world. Perhaps you can find something useful in my 
ideas/solutions that could benefit a project of yours. If you do, I ask that you give proper credit (Alexander Tsepkov - atsepkov@gmail.com) 

As far as interview problems, I don't share where I saw a particular problem as that would be unfair to the company giving the 
interview. The idea is that lazy individuals wishing to cheat will never search past the ignorant queries like "[company name] interview solution" 
but those willing to study arbitrary problems and solutions are probably doing so to better themselves rather than to obtain a 
quick undeserved advantage.
