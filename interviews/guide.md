# Guide
There are a few things I want to test during the interview. In particular:

- Are they who their resume claims they are?
- Are they a real developer or a wannabe dev who slapped together their first web app?
- Do they have a solid understanding of programming fundamentals?
- Do they have a solid understanding of development/release process?
- Is their passion in software?
- Are they a one-trick pony?

## Questions to Ask
These will work well for remote interviews too, you can use collabedit.com or something similar for code-along sessions. Questions in bold can make good programming questions too.

### Object-Oriented Concepts
These questions test their understanding of OOP.

- Why is multiple inheritance good and why is it bad?
- How does an interface differ from an abstract class?
- What's the difference between method overloading and method overwriting?

### Approach and Scripting (One-Off Tasks)
These questions test their common sense and ability to tackle the task correctly and quickly. They test developer's ability to tackle problems that may not be in their immediate niche.

- **You're tasked with pulling out phone numbers from a large collection of .html documents, describe your approach.**
- **You're tasked with finding all words inside `<span>` tags in a large .html document, describe your approach.**

### Productivity
These questions test their passion, adherence to best practices and ability to get things done. WARNING: these are open-ended, so make sure the interview doesn't turn into a conversation.

- What's your favorite (IDE/language/stack) and why?
- What tools do you use to help you write better code?

### Testing and Debugging
These test their familiarity with QA best practices and ability to make correct assumptions.

- Manager informed you that a page written by a coworker is working very slowly, describe how you would troubleshoot it.
- You've just added a new feature to the app your team is working on, describe the process to get it shipped.

### Data Structures
These test their ability to pick correct data structures for correct tasks and also their understanding of data structures in general.

- Describe the difference between a vector and an array.
- Describe the difference between a hashmap and an array.
- What's the insertion time for (array/hashmap/linked list/tree)? What's the access time for (array/hasmap/linked list/tree)?
- **How would you build a hashmap if the language you're coding in didn't have one?**
- **You're implementing a simple calculator that takes a sequence of tokens and returns result, what's your data structure of choice, why?**
