Description
===========
Write a function that takes a floating point number that represents progress and a integer that represents number of character bins and outputs a string representing a progress bar. You're free to use whichever characters you want as long as it's clear what the progress is.

Grading
-------
- does it work for general case?
- does it fail gracefully for bad inputs?
	- negative progress
	- progress over 100%
	- infinite number of bins
	- negative number of bins
- **bonus**: does it use unicode/asci art to show higher precision?
