# Project Euler Challenges
These are from projecteuler.net. I've solved many of these a long time ago in Python and Ruby. However, since the website's challenges provide a good way to learn algorithms and/or a new language, I decided to use them both to test out my language's brevity and as a shameless plug for my language: [RapydScript](https://github.com/atsepkov/RapydScript).
