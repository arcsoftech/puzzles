# Project Euler Challenges
These are from projecteuler.net. I've solved many of these a long time ago in Python and Ruby. However, since the website's challenges provide a good way to learn algorithms and/or a new language, I decided to use them both to test out my language's brevity and as a shameless plug for my language: [RapydScript](https://github.com/atsepkov/RapydScript).

# Timing
The goal is to have these solutions execute efficiently, as per Project Euler guidelines. I use node's internal timer to time and output these results via the `test` script:

	1.pyj: 1ms
	2.pyj: 76ms
	3.pyj: 2ms
	4.pyj: 5ms
	5.pyj: 1ms
	6.pyj: 1ms
	7.pyj: 8ms
	8.pyj: 1ms
	9.pyj: 1ms
	10.pyj: 123ms
	11.pyj: 4ms
	12.pyj: 317ms
	13.pyj: 1ms
	14.pyj: 2279ms
	15.pyj: 1ms
